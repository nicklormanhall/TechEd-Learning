          <h3>Strawberry daiquiri</h3>
          <p>
            A refreshing and fruity cocktail that has gained popularity for its
            vibrant red color and delicious taste. It is a classic rum-based
            drink that combines the sweetness of fresh strawberries with the
            tangy kick of lime juice. The cocktail is typically blended with ice
            to create a smooth and slushy texture, making it a perfect choice
            for hot summer days or tropical-themed parties. The strawberry
            daiquiri is often garnished with a fresh strawberry or a slice of
            lime, adding a touch of visual appeal. With its balance of sweet and
            tart flavors, the Strawberry Daiquiri is a beloved cocktail that
            embodies the essence of a delightful and indulgent summer beverage.
