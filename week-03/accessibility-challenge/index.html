        <h3>Strawberry daiquiri</h3>
        <p>
          A refreshing and fruity cocktail that has gained popularity for its
          vibrant red color and delicious taste. It is a classic rum-based drink
          that combines the sweetness of fresh strawberries with the tangy kick
          of lime juice. The cocktail is typically blended with ice to create a
          smooth and slushy texture, making it a perfect choice for hot summer
          days or tropical-themed parties. The strawberry daiquiri is often
          garnished with a fresh strawberry or a slice of lime, adding a touch
          of visual appeal. With its balance of sweet and tart flavors, the
          Strawberry Daiquiri is a beloved cocktail that embodies the essence of
          a delightful and indulgent summer beverage.
